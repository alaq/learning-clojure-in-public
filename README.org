* Learning Clojure in Public
I am challenging myself to learn Clojure in public. Starting on July 22nd, 2020
and for the next five weeks I will be learning Clojure in public and you can
hold me accountable. I am committing the code I am writing to the ~./code~
folder, and will also write daily posts detailing what I learned and what I did to
learn it.

If you would like to read why I am doing this, read the [[file:posts/2020-06-18.org][introduction]].

When I announced this on [[https://twitter.com/adrien/status/1273013237076971528][Twitter]] I got an interesting suggestion:

So here it goes: if I miss a day, you will be able ask me to send you $5 (Venmo or PayPal
preferred). If by the next morning
(I often work late) I have not updated this repository with the previous' day's progress you can
claim it by reaching out to [[https://twitter.com/adrien][me]] on Twitter. There is a limit of five people per
missed post.
