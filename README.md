# Learning Clojure in Public

I am challenging myself to learn Clojure in public. Starting on July 22nd, 2020 and for the next five weeks I will be learning Clojure in public and you can hold me accountable. I am committing the code I am writing to the `./code` folder, and will also write daily posts detailing what I learned and what I did to learn it.

If you would like to read why I am doing this, read the [introduction](posts/2020-06-18.md).

When I announced this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adrien/status/1273013237076971528) I got an interesting suggestion:

So here it goes: if I miss a day, you will be able ask me to send you \$5 (Venmo or PayPal preferred). If by the next morning (I often work late) I have not updated this repository with the previous' day's progress you can claim it by reaching out to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adrien). There is a limit of five people per missed post.
