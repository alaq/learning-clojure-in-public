# Learning Clojure in Public - Week 2 Day 4 (11/35)

## Expectations

Today I am starting [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://braveclojure.com). My expectation is to skim chapter 1 & 2, and to read chapter 3. I will only take notes about the things that are new to me, or that I feel should be repeated for the sake of me learning them.

## What I learned

### Datastructures review

Since I am only writing little tidbits of information I will use bullet points:

-   When using an `if`, the else expression is optional
-   `do` groups expressions together, useful if you need to do several things in the then statement of an `if`
-   `when` is a like the combination of `if` and `do`, it's taking a binary expression and will evaluate all the other arguments if it is true
-   `or` and `and` are interesting in the sense that they will return the respectively the first and the last truthy value
-   In Clojure, you bind a name to a value with `def`. As opposed to JavaScript it is encourage to assign and re-assign (a lot less in TypeScript I found out). In Clojure you end up using functions and not modifying the symbols. There is usually not equivalent to reassigning in place in a datastructure.

#### Summary of types and datastructures

-   numbers
-   string
-   maps `{}` (similar to hashes or dictionaries in other languages)
    -   they can be nested
    -   there are hash-maps and sorted-maps
    -   `hash-map` creates a map: `(hash-map :a 1 :b 2)`
    -   can also be used as a function to retrieve a value: `({:a 1} :a)` => `1`, but also `(:a {:a 1})` => `1`
-   keywords `:a`
-   vectors `[1 2 3]`
    -   you can also use `get` on them, with the index as the second argument
-   lists `'(1 2 3)`
-   sets are collections of unique values `#{"hello" 1 :hi}`
    -   `hash-set` creates a set
    -   to get a value you can use `contains?`, `get`, or use a keyword as function

### Functions

-   Functions that can take a function as an argument, or return a function are higher-order functions.
-   It is possible to define multiple functions depending on how many arguments you pass to a function:

```clojure
(defn multi-arity
  ;; 3-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg third-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg third-arg))
  ;; 2-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg))
  ;; 1-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg]
     (do-things first-arg)))
```

It's also a way to define default arguments:

```clojure
(defn x-chop
  "Describe the kind of chop you're inflicting on someone"
  ([name chop-type]
     (str "I " chop-type " chop " name "! Take that!"))
  ([name]
     (x-chop name "karate")))
```

#### Destructuring

You can bind names to values within a collection:

```clojure
(defn destruct
  [[a b & c]]
  (println (str "1 " a))
  (println (str "2 " b))
  (println (str "rest " c)))
```

You can also destructure maps:

```clojure
(defn destruct-map
  [{a :a b :b}]
  (println (str "1 " a))
  (println (str "2 " b)))

=> (destruct-map {:a 1 :b 2})
```

An even shorter way is:

```clojure
(defn announce-treasure-location
  [{:keys [lat lng]}]
  (println (str "Treasure lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Treasure lng: " lng)))
```

Using `:as` lets you retain access to the original map:

```clojure
(defn receive-treasure-location
  [{:keys [lat lng] :as treasure-location}]
  (println (str "Treasure lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Treasure lng: " lng))

  ;; One would assume that this would put in new coordinates for your ship
  (steer-ship! treasure-location))
```

### Loops

I have not covered `loop` yet.

```clojure
(loop [i 0] ; initialize i at 0
  (printl (str i))
  (if (> i 4) ; here will stop the loop
    (println "end")
    (recur (int i)))) ; here we increment i and start the loop again
```

Loop has much better performance than a recursive call.

### Clojure for the Brave and True Chapter 3 Exercises

#### 1. Use str, vector, list, hash-map and hash-set

````clojure
(str "hello " "world")
(vector '(1 2 3))
(list 1 2 3)
(hash-map :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)
(hash-set 1 1 2)```
#### 2. Write a function that takes a number and adds 100 to it
```clojure
#(+ % 100)
````

#### 3. Write a function, dec-maker, that works exactly like the function inc-maker except with subtraction:

```clojure
(defn dec-maker
  [n]
  #(- % n))

(def dec9 (dec-maker 9))
(dec9 10)
```

#### 4. Write a function, mapset, that works like map except the return value is a set:

```clojure
(defn mapset
  [f coll]
  (set (map f coll)))
```

#### 5. Create a function that’s similar to symmetrize-body-parts except that it has to work with weird space aliens with radial symmetry. Instead of two eyes, arms, legs, and so on, they have five.

```clojure
(defn matching-parts
  [part]
  #{{:name (clojure.string/replace (:name part) #"^left-" "top-")
   :size (:size part)}
      {:name (clojure.string/replace (:name part) #"^left-" "right-")
   :size (:size part)}
      {:name (clojure.string/replace (:name part) #"^left-" "bottom-left-")
   :size (:size part)}
      {:name (clojure.string/replace (:name part) #"^left-" "bottom-right-")
   :size (:size part)}})

(defn symmetrize-body-parts
  "Expects a seq of maps that have a :name and :size"
  [asym-body-parts]
  (loop [remaining-asym-parts asym-body-parts
         final-body-parts []]
    (if (empty? remaining-asym-parts)
      final-body-parts
      (let [[part & remaining] remaining-asym-parts]
        (recur remaining
               (into final-body-parts
                     (conj (matching-parts part) part)))))))
```

## Takeaways

Overall it was a good revision of what I have learned in Clojure from the Ground Up. The order of things is a little bit different which is refreshing. Some things we didn't cover in CFTGU were covered at the beginning of the chapter (like loops).

I also did 5 out of 6 of the exercises in this chapter. They were quite easy but that makes sense as it is the fist chapter a beginner would study.
Let's end the day with a tally of what I completed:

-   Chapter 3 of Clojure for the Brave and True
-   5 problems included in the first chapter
