* Why Am I Doing This?
Learning is fun, learning in public is harder, so then why am I doing it?
** üìí I want to be held accountable
I am doing this for myself (see above, the primary reason is to learn, selfishly) and do not expect any sort of audience. Now if I artificially get an audience by promising easy money, that is a win! If I can't get out of this (not that I will), or if it hurts to skip a day I have a better chance for it to stick.

Now there's a whole lot people on Twitter that will hold me accountable!
** ü§ù I want to meet new people
Since announcing my intention to learn Clojure in public on Twitter, I have already received feedback from strangers, found new (relevant) accounts to follow and been followed by new people.
I am not trying to draw early conclusions, but any interaction around Clojure is already a plus and will probably me more than if I had stayed dark (i.e. learning in my corner).
** ü¶æ I want to create a habit
When I first seriously learned how to write code, I committed to keeping my GitHub streak going. It was after I graduated from bootcamp and I was a TA it was easy to fall off the bandwagon so instead I forced myself to commit something everyday. It didn't matter how small. It went on for a few months until I got a job and I started committing somewhere else.
I hope to recreate this here.
** ‚≠ï I want to be corrected
If I don't put anything out there, how will I know when I am wrong? Hopefully I can recreate the feedback loop you can experience in school, but using people of the internet!
** üë®‚Äçüé§ (if possible) I want to inspire
I was myself inspired by watching others learn in public. If I can convince one person to do it as well (especially if it turns out to be successful) then it's another win.
** ‚úçÔ∏è I want to get in the habit of writing
I rarely write. And when I do, it's as little as possible. In the description of my pull request I am almost laconic. This is probably an easy way to fight this, not dissimilar to people joining Toastmasters to change their attitude towards public speaking.
* Why Clojure?
** üìñ I want to contribute to open source
Whenever I learned something and it stuck was when I was learning to build something. It has been for myself or someone else. I learned bash scripting when I wanted to automate my media server, I learned JavaScript because I needed to go from websites to applications, etc. I want to contribute to Athens because it's a project I would use so that looks like a good match as well as a learning opportunity.
** üíª I've always been interested in Lisps
It started with emacs and I wanted to customize it with emacs-lisp then a curiosity in its own right. I read [[https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/concrete-abstractions.html][Concrete Abstractions ‚Äì An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme]] and I've considered tackling Clojure as a lisp that is actually used in production.
** Other reasons
- I heard it fits very nicely with React, I'm here to see for myself.
- I am interested in functional programming.
- And all the other advantages: simplicity, macros, the REPL, ClojureScript
* Environment Setup
At this point I do not know what the ideal setup will be for me so I have
setup two differents ones and I will later which one is appropriate
