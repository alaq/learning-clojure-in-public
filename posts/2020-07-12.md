# Learning Clojure in Public - Week 3 Day 7 (21/35)

## Expectations

Yesterday I started reading chapter 9 of Clojure for the Brave and True, and the expectation for today is to complete it and its exercises.

## What I learned

### Promises

Promises allow you to express that you expect a result without having to define the task that should produce it or when that task should run. You create promises using promise and deliver a result to them using deliver. You obtain the result by dereferencing:

```clojure
(def my-promise (promise))
(deliver my-promise (+ 1 2))
@my-promise
; => 3
```

If a promise never returns a value it will block the thread forever so it might be good to make it time out after an amount of milliseconds, like so:

```clojure
(let [p (promise)]
  (deref p 100 "timed out"))
```

It is also possible for a future to take a callback, to be executed

```clojure
(let [ferengi-wisdom-promise (promise)]
  (future (println "Here's some Ferengi wisdom:" @ferengi-wisdom-promise))
  (Thread/sleep 100)
  (deliver ferengi-wisdom-promise "Whisper your way to success."))
; => Here's some Ferengi wisdom: Whisper your way to success.
```

### Rolling my own queue

We start by defining a macro:

```clojure
(defmacro wait
  "Sleep `timeout` seconds before evaluating body"
  [timeout & body]
  `(do (Thread/sleep ~timeout) ~@body))
```

Then we split up tasks into a concurrent portion and a serialized portion like so:

```clojure
(let [saying3 (promise)]
  (future (deliver saying3 (wait 100 "Cheerio!")))
  @(let [saying2 (promise)]
     (future (deliver saying2 (wait 400 "Pip pip!")))
      @(let [saying1 (promise)]
        (future (deliver saying1 (wait 200 "'Ello, gov'na!")))
        (println @saying1)
        saying1)
     (println @saying2)
     saying2)
  (println @saying3)
  saying3)
```

...which can be replaced by a macro:

```clojure
(defmacro enqueue
   ([q concurrent-promise-name concurrent serialized]
    `(let [~concurrent-promise-name (promise)]
      (future (deliver ~concurrent-promise-name ~concurrent))
       (deref ~q)
      ~serialized
      ~concurrent-promise-name))
   ([concurrent-promise-name concurrent serialized]
   `(enqueue (future) ~concurrent-promise-name ~concurrent ~serialized)))
```

...which you can use like this:

```clojure
(-> (enqueue saying (wait 200 "'Ello, gov'na!") (println @saying))
   (enqueue saying (wait 400 "Pip pip!") (println @saying))
    (enqueue saying (wait 100 "Cheerio!") (println @saying)))
```

The result is:

```clojure
(time @(-> (enqueue saying (wait 200 "'Ello, gov'na!") (println @saying))
           (enqueue saying (wait 400 "Pip pip!") (println @saying))
           (enqueue saying (wait 100 "Cheerio!") (println @saying))))
; => 'Ello, gov'na!
; => Pip pip!
; => Cheerio!
; => "Elapsed time: 401.635 msecs"
```

### Chapter 9 Exercises

1. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and searches for it on Bing and Google using the slurp function. Your function should return the HTML of the first page returned by the search.

```clojure
(defn first-html
  [query]
  (let [result-promise (promise)]
    (future (deliver result-promise (slurp (str "https://www.google.com/search?q%3D" query)))) @result-promise))

(re-seq #"https?://[^\"]*" (first-html "hello"))
```

2. Update your function so it takes a second argument consisting of the search engines to use.

```clojure
(defn first-html
  [query engine]
  (let [result-promise (promise)]
    (future (deliver result-promise (slurp (str engine query)))) @result-promise))
```

3. Create a new function that takes a search term and search engines as arguments, and returns a vector of the URLs from the first page of search results from each search engine.

```clojure
(defn get-urls [query engines]
  (vec (flatten (map #(re-seq #"https?://[^\"]*" (first-html %)) engines))))
```

## Takeaways

Futures let you define a task and execute it immediately, allowing you to require the result later or never. Futures also cache their results. Delays let you define a task that doesn’t get executed until later, and a delay’s result gets cached. Promises let you express that you require a result without having to know about the task that produces that result. You can only deliver a value to a promise once.

Let's end the day with a tally of what I completed:
