# Learning Clojure in Public - Week 1 Day 7 (7/35)

## Expectations

I was travelling again today so my expectation was to complete Chapter 7 and maybe tackle the exercises. I am very happy to report that I was able to finish the chapter, do the exercises (despite some little setup issues with the scratch project) and on top of that do 3 4clojure problems!

## What I learned

Yesterday, I finished with getting the driving under the influence data per county.

```clojure
user=> (->> data (sort-by :driving_under_influence) (take-last 10) (map #(select-keys % [:driving_under_influence :fips_county_code :fips_state_code])) pprint)
({:fips_state_code "06",
  :fips_county_code "067",
  :driving_under_influence 8589}
```

I then import `fips.json`, our goal being to use it to get the county names. `keys` will return the keys' names for the data.

```clojure
user=> (keys fips)
(:table)
user=> (keys (:table fips))
(:columnNames :columnTypes :rows)
user=> (->> fips :table :columnNames)
["FIPS" "Name"]
user=> (->> fips :table :rows (take 3) pprint)
(["02000" "AK"]
 ["02013" "AK, Aleutians East"]
 ["02016" "AK, Aleutians West"])
```

After loading `fips.json`, we can start playing in the REPL again:

```clojure
user=> (use 'scratch.crime :reload)
nil
user=> (fips "10001")
"DE, Kent"
```

After updating `crime.clj`, we can do:

```clojure
user=> (use 'scratch.crime :reload) (pprint (most-duis "2008.json"))
({:fips_state_code "06",
  :fips_county_code "067",
  :driving_under_influence 8589}
 {:fips_state_code "48",
  :fips_county_code "201",
  :driving_under_influence 10432}
```

After our updates to crime.clj:

```clojure
user=> (use 'scratch.crime :reload) (pprint (most-duis "2008.json"))
nil
{"CA, Orange" 17572,
 "CA, San Bernardino" 13983,
 "CA, Los Angeles" 45056,
 "CA, Riverside" 10814,
```

### Other notes

I wasn't able to import all the symbols from other namespaces in my test files so I had to explicitly list them:

```clojure
(ns cftgu-chapter6.crime-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [cftgu-chapter6.crime :refer [fips-code]]))
```

### Chapter 7 Problems

#### Problem 1

```clojure
(defn prevalence-of-duis
  "Prevalence of DUIs."
  [file]
  (->> file
       load-json
       (map (fn [county]
              {:county (fips (fips-code county))
               :duis (:driving_under_influence county)
               :population (:county_population county)
               :prevalence (double (if
                                    (pos? (:county_population county))
                                     (/ (:driving_under_influence county) (:county_population county))
                                     0))}))
       (sort-by :prevalence)
       (take-last 10)))
```

#### Problem 2

```clojure
(defn most-duis
  "Given a JSON filename of UCR crime data for a particular year, finds the counties with the most DUIs."
  [file]
  (->> file
       load-json
       (sort-by :driving_under_influence)
       (take-last 10)
       (map (fn [county]
              [(fips (fips-code county))
               [:duis (:driving_under_influence county)
                :population (:county_population county)
                :report-count (:grand_total county)
                :prevalence (double (/ (:driving_under_influence county) (:county_population county)))]]))
       (into {})))
```

#### Problem 3

```clojure
(defn most-prevalent
  "Given a JSON filename of UCR crime data for a particular year, and a crime, find the counties with the highest prevalence of this crime."
  [file crime]
  (->> file
       load-json
       (map (fn [county]
              {:county (fips (fips-code county))
               :occurrence (crime county)
               :population (:county_population county)
               :prevalence (double (if
                                    (pos?
                                     (:county_population county))
                                     (/
                                      (crime county)
                                      (:county_population county))
                                     0))}))
       (sort-by :prevalence)
       (take-last 10)))
```

## Takeaways

The difficulty in this part lies with setting up the project properly: you can come up with the right code and still get errors. For instance I was not able to have the tests and the code (in the REPL) work at the same time. It's one or the other, not the two at the same time.

-   [Working tests](https://github.com/alaq/learning-clojure-in-public/tree/b5671e7eaf57d271c9ed9d156d5684142d1ec530)
-   [Working REPL](https://github.com/alaq/learning-clojure-in-public/tree/6bc7bce90f2b0d7acd63ab01a0ebb847844c76c1)

The second difficulty is understanding how to process the JSON itself. The map function is useful but I will definitely have to cover the material again to properly understand it and be able to apply it with different data sets.

Let's end the day with a tally of what I completed:

-   Finished Chapter 7 of Clojure From the Ground Up
-   Solved the problems at the end of Chapter 7
-   3 4clojure problems (I'm getting back in the groove!)
