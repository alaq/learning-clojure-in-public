# Learning Clojure in Public - Week 5 Day 3 (31/35)

## Expectations

The only expectation of the day is to open the pull request for the page deletion issue in Athens.

## What I learned

And open the PR we did, and even earlier than I expected. Here is a rundown of the most recent changes. First I added Mani's function to get the children of a block from its `uid`:

```clojure
(defn get-children-recursively
  "Get list of children UIDs for given block ID"
  [uid]
  (let [document (->> @(pull dsdb '[:block/order :block/uid {:block/children ...}] (get-id uid)))]
    (->> (tree-seq :block/children :block/children document)
         (map :block/uid))))
```

He also wrote a helper function to get the database id, from the `uid`:

```clojure
(defn get-id
  [uid]
  (-> (d/q '[:find ?id
             :in $ ?uid
             :where [?id :block/uid ?uid]]
           @dsdb
           uid)
      ffirst))
```

Finally we use the function itself in the event handler so we can delete all the `UID`s retrieved by `get-children-recursively`. Datascript's `:transact!` can take a vector of vectors to batch delete several entries in the database (hence the use of `vec`, since `map` returns a list).

```clojure
(reg-event-fx
  :page/delete
  (fn [_ [_ uid]]
    {:transact! (vec (map (fn [uid] [:db/retract [:block/uid uid] :block/uid]) (get-children-recursively uid)))}))
```

The [PR](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/pull/295) has been opened and is awaiting feedback.

## Takeaways

Not much to bring up and to takeaway. I am learning a lot more about how the different pieces I studied fit together. It really feels like the fun stuff is happening right now. Yet there is still a lot of ground to cover. A few things I want to dig deeper into are datascript, paredit (to edit faster!) and datalog (again)!
