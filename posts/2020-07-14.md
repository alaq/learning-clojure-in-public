# Learning Clojure in Public - Week 4 Day 2 (23/35)

## What I learned

### Refs

Refs allow you to update the state of multiple identities using transaction semantics. These transactions have three features:

-   They are **atomic**, meaning that all refs are updated or none of them are.
-   They are **consistent**, meaning that the refs always appear to have valid states. A sock will always belong to a dryer or a gnome, but never both or neither.
-   They are **isolated**, meaning that transactions behave as if they executed serially; if two threads are simultaneously running transactions that alter the same ref, one transaction will retry. This is similar to the compare-and-set semantics of atoms.

We're going to walk through sock transfer example from Chapter 10 of Brave Clojure:

````clojure
(def sock-varieties
  #{"darned" "argyle" "wool" "horsehair" "mulleted"
    "passive-aggressive" "striped" "polka-dotted"
    "athletic" "business" "power" "invisible" "gollumed"})

(defn sock-count
  [sock-variety count]
  {:variety sock-variety
   :count count})

(defn generate-sock-gnome
  "Create an initial sock gnome state with no socks"
  [name]
  {:name name
   :socks #{}})

(def sock-gnome (ref (generate-sock-gnome "Barumpharumph")))
(def dryer (ref {:name "LG 1337"
                 :socks (set (map #(sock-count % 2) sock-varieties))}))```
Then we can deference our refs, like this:
```clojure
(:socks @dryer)
; => #{{:variety "passive-aggressive", :count 2} {:variety "power", :count 2}
       {:variety "athletic", :count 2} {:variety "business", :count 2}
       {:variety "argyle", :count 2} {:variety "horsehair", :count 2}
       {:variety "gollumed", :count 2} {:variety "darned", :count 2}
       {:variety "polka-dotted", :count 2} {:variety "wool", :count 2}
       {:variety "mulleted", :count 2} {:variety "striped", :count 2}
       {:variety "invisible", :count 2}}
````

To modify a ref we use `alter` which needs to be used within a transaction that you can initiate with `dosync`.

```clojure
(defn steal-sock
  [gnome dryer]
  (dosync
   (when-let [pair (some #(if (= (:count %) 2) %) (:socks @dryer))]
     (let [updated-count (sock-count (:variety pair) 1)]
       (alter gnome update-in [:socks] conj updated-count)
       (alter dryer update-in [:socks] disj pair)
       (alter dryer update-in [:socks] conj updated-count)))))
(steal-sock sock-gnome dryer)

(:socks @sock-gnome)
; => #{{:variety "passive-aggressive", :count 1}}
```

### Commute

`commute` allows you to update a ref’s state within a transaction, just like alter. However, its behavior at commit time is completely different. Here’s how alter behaves:

-   Reach outside the transaction and read the ref’s current state.
-   Compare the current state to the state the ref started with within the transaction.
-   If the two differ, make the transaction retry.
-   Otherwise, commit the altered ref state.
    commute, on the other hand, behaves like this at commit time:
-   Reach outside the transaction and read the ref’s current state.
-   Run the commute function again using the current state.
-   Commit the result.
    This is how to use a `ref`:

```clojure
(defn sleep-print-update
  [sleep-time thread-name update-fn]
  (fn [state]
    (Thread/sleep sleep-time)
    (println (str thread-name ": " state))
    (update-fn state)))
(def counter (ref 0))
(future (dosync (commute counter (sleep-print-update 100 "Thread A" inc))))
(future (dosync (commute counter (sleep-print-update 150 "Thread B" inc))))
```

### Vars

`vars` are associations between symbols and objects. They are created with `def`.

#### Dynamic binding

You can acually create a dynamic binding with `^:dynamic` in front of the name and the name itself is enclosed in asteriks:

```clojure
(def ^:dynamic *notification-address* "dobby@elf.org")
```

And this is how you change it:

```(binding [*notification-address* "test@elf.org"]
  *notification-address*); => "test@elf.org"
```

It behaves kind of like a `let`, the var is changed only within the `binding` expression.

Dynamic vars can be used for function targets, like `*out*`. Dynamic vars are also used for configuration. For example, the built-in var *print-length* allows you to specify how many items in a collection Clojure should print:

```(println ["Print" "all" "the" "things!"])
; => [Print all the things!]

(binding [*print-length* 1]
  (println ["Print" "just" "one!"]))
; => [Print ...]
```

`set!` can also be used to set a dynamic binding's value.

#### Altering the var root

The var root is the initial value that you supply to `def`. And for this we need to use `alter-var-root`, like this:

```clojure
(def power-source "hair")
(alter-var-root #'power-source (fn [_] "7-eleven parking lot"))

power-source
; => "7-eleven parking lot"
```

### Stateless Concurrency and Parallelism with pmap

`pmap` is basically `map` with added parallelism. With `pmap` each application of the mapping is handled on a separate thread.

### Brave Clojure Chapter 10 Exercises

#### 1. Create an atom with the initial value 0, use swap! to increment it a couple of times, and then dereference it.

````clojure
(def my-atom (atom 0))
(swap! my-atom (fn [current-value] (inc current-value)))
(swap! my-atom (fn [current-value] (inc current-value)))
(swap! my-atom (fn [current-value] (inc current-value)))
@my-atom```
#### 2. Create a function that uses futures to parallelize the task of downloading random quotes from__http://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote__ using (slurp "http://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote"). The futures should update an atom that refers to a total word count for all quotes. The function will take the number of quotes to download as an argument and return the atom’s final value. Keep in mind that you’ll need to ensure that all futures have finished before returning the atom’s final value.
```clojure
(def quote-word-frequencies (atom {}))

(defn word-frequencies [string]
  (frequencies (clojure.string/split string #"\W+")))

(defn get-quote-and-add-word-frequencies []
  (swap! quote-word-frequencies (fn [current-state] (merge-with + current-state (word-frequencies (slurp "https://braveclojure.com/random-quote"))))))

(defn create-futures
  [n]
  (repeatedly n #(future get-quote-and-word-frequency)))

(defn get-futures
  [futures]
  (dorun (pmap deref futures)))

(defn quote-word-count [n]
  (get-futures (create-futures n)))

(quote-word-count 5)
````

At this point this will not work, and I am not sure why. I spent some time trying to debug it and I will come back and fix it.

#### 3. Create representations of two characters in a game. The first character has 15 hit points out of a total of 40. The second character has a healing potion in his inventory. Use refs and transactions to model the consumption of the healing potion and the first character healing.

```clojure
(def char1 (ref {:healing_potion 1}))
(def char2 (ref {:health 15}))
(def max-health 40)

(defn healing
  [healer receiver]
  (dosync
   (alter healer update-in [:healing_potion] dec)
   (alter receiver assoc-in [:health] max-health)))

(healing char1 char2)

(print @char1)
(print @char2)
```

## Takeaways

In this chapter, I reviewed ways to safely handling concurrent tasks. State is the value of an identity at a point in time, and identity is a handy way to refer to a succession of values produced by some process.

The atom allows to create an identity that we can safely refer to, update with new values with `swap!` or `reset!`.

The ref reference type is useful when there are more than one reference type to update (with `alter!` or `commute!`).

Let's end the day with a tally of what I completed:

-   Finished Chapter 10 of Clojure for the Brave and True
-   Also covered its exercises (despite the fact that I have to come back to exercise 2)
